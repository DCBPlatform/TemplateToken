# Template Token    

This !ink smart contract is based on ERC20 Minter Burner token standard. This is to allow users or developers in the DCB ecosystem to publish their own tokens and work on DCB Platform to create Decentralised Finance ("DeFi") projects such as fractional reserves stable coins or undercollateralised lending projets.

## Motivation

I would like readers to know the motivations for people to read and clone this repo:

* Easier for people to publish their own token and use case.
* Ensure that there is a standard in publishing token
* Encourage usage of DCB Platform
